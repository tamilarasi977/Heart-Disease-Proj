 
Heart Disease Dataset using Machine Learning

Project Overview:
Developed a simple heart diseases project using python and pandas. Collected patient health data (age, blood pressure). Implemented a basic rule-based prediction system to simply classify whether a patient us at risk of heart diseases.

Technologies Used:
‚Ä¢	Python üêç
‚Ä¢	Pandas for Data Manipulation
‚Ä¢	Matplotlib for Data Visualization

How to Run This Project:
1.	Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2.	Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib 
3.	Ensure you have the heart.csv dataset in the same directory.
4.	Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells step by step.
